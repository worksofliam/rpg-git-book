## Expectations

This books exists because it should be made clear to the IBM i community that modern workflow and development is possible with new or old C, RPG and COBOL applications (or any ILE language for that matter).

From this book, you can expect to learn a lot of things. Ranging from the installation of yum, creating repositories, migrating source code and deploying your application.

You should also note that every piece of software in this book will cost you nothing but time. All the tools used will be free, with the exception of Rational Developer for i - although we will still explain how to use Rational Developer for i when developing applications in the IFS. You should be able to walk away from this book knowing the full life cycle for developing applications using a modern distributed workflow, with the ability to feel confident developing applications in your own safe environment.

The end goal is that you will know every step in migrating an application into git, with the use of a cloud repository provider (like GitHub) - including how to integrate a continuous integration and deployment tool.

Each chapter should follow the same structure:

* What this chapter is about and why it's needed
* The content of the chapter, including how-tos and information text
* What you should have learned from the chapter.
